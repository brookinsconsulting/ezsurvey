Installing eZ Survey extension
====================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on
   the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezsurvey-extension-1.0.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezsurvey-extension-1.0.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezsurvey-extension-1.0.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit
   site.ini.append(.php) in the folder root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this
   file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add) the block
   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezsurvey

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the
   sites should use the extension, make the changes in the override file of
   that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezsurvey


Initializing database

   --------------

   o  Initialize schema

     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.

     You can start by insert the schema for the extension and then filling it
     with the basic data.

     o  Create the schema
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
