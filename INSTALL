2. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using eZ Survey extension:

   o  eZ publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ publish version 3.4 or higher.

   o  PHP version:

      Make sure you have PHP 4.3.2 or higher.


Getting eZ publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/download/all_releases/ez_publish_3_stable_releases

NOTE: You will require eZ publish 3.4 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/installation


Installing eZ Survey extension
====================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on
   the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezsurvey-extension-1.0.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezsurvey-extension-1.0.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezsurvey-extension-1.0.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit
   site.ini.append(.php) in the folder root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this
   file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add) the block
   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezsurvey

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the
   sites should use the extension, make the changes in the override file of
   that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezsurvey


Initializing database
=====================

1. Manual install
   --------------

   o  Initialize schema

     The schema must now be created with all the tables, sequences and
     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.
     Here you have two choices:

     You can start by insert the schema for the extension and then filling it
     with the basic data.

     o  Create the schema
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            share/db_schema.dba <dbname>

     o  Insert data
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            --schema-file=share/db_schema.dba \
            --insert-types=data \
            share/db_data.dba <dbname>

I changed the ezsurvey extension so that it can be integrated with ez publish. You can manage ezsurvey
object in a standard ez publish way. I still use a "survey" content object as a wrapper object between
ez publish and the ezsurvey object, but this time you don't need to create the "survey" object manually.
After you create an "ezsurvey", the wrapper object will be created automatically. If you remove an "ezsurvey" 
object, the wrapper object will be removed as well. 

I also fixed a few bugs. The most critical bug is: formatted paragraph causes a fetal error when "ezdhtml" extension is 
installed. 


*NOTE: 
I assume that you have installed ezpublish. 
So the first thing you need to do is executing the sql/mysql/schema.sql to create the ezsurvey tables.

Then, please follow the instruction below to integrate ez survey into ez publish:

1. Import ezsurvey.ezpkg or create a survey content class as the following:

   + class name: Survey
   + identifier: survey
   + object name pattern: <survey_name>

   Attributes:

   Survey name [Text line]
   Name: Survey name
   Identifier: survey_name

   Survey number [Integer]
   Name: Survey number
   Identifier: survey_number
   Default value: 1

2. Create a folder called "surveys" under the root node (ezpublish)

3. Remember the node_id of "surveys" folder

4. Change settings/ezsurvey.ini.append.php
   replace "SURVEYS_FOLDER_NODE_ID" to the node_id of "surveys" folder

   The [PathTextSettings] is used to generate the path information. 
   [PathNodeIDSettings] is used to set correct status in the side tree.
   If you, for example, created "surveys" folder in "root/resources/surveys"
   And the node ids are: 
   + root:2
   + resources:100
   + surveys: 120

   Then the ezsurvey.ini.append.php should look like:
   [PathTextSettings]
   PathText[]=ezpublish
   PathText[]=Resources
   PathText[]=Surveys
    
   [PathNodeIDSettings]
   PathNodeID[]=2
   PathNodeID[]=100
   PathNodeID[]=120

5. open settings/override.ini.append.php
   Change "SURVEYS_FOLDER_NODE_ID" to the node id of "surveys" folder
   Follow the comments to set up the override rules in corresponding files.

6. clean up caches

7. You can also change the navigation part for ezsurvey. This can be changed in modules/survey/module.php
   (Change the default_navigation_part if necessary)
