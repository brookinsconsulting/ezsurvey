# Installation
1. Copy ezsury to your extension folder
2. Activate it in your site.ini.append.php file
3. Make sure "survey" class doesn't exist
4. Import ezsurvey.ezpkg
5. Create a folder called "Surveys" (In fact, you can change the name)
 5.1 If you are using "tools" tab extension, we recommend you create 
     it as "tools/resouces/surveys"
6. Remember the node_id and node_text of each node in the full path to surveys folder.
   And change the ezsurvey.ini.append.php accordingly
7. Change the override rules in override.ini.append.php and apply the rules to corresponding files
8. If you are using "tools" tab extension, since "tools" tab uses its own navigation part, you are supposed to 
   change the navigation part in ezsurvey/modules/module.php
9. Cleanup caches
10. Signon at backend and access the "surveys" folder
11. Now you can manage surveys under survey folder in a standard ezpublish way.

*NOTE 
since ezsurvey extension is not using ezpublish content object model, it's impossible to integrate it 
with ezpublish directly. That's why we created the "survey" class as a wrapper between ezpublish and ezsurvey. 
So the surveys you see under the "surveys" folder are not the "ezsurvey" records, but the "survey" wrapper records.
But we've changed the code base, so that when you open a "survey" wrapper record, you will see the real ezsurvey contents but not the "survey" wrapper contents. In fact, you can totally ignore the "survey" warpper.

However, I didn't change the code base of the "popup menu" in "node tree", so if you click on 
the "popup menu" in "node tree" window, it still brings up the "survey" wrapper record.
It provides an advanced way to change the "survey" wrapper record. But We also highly recommend you not 
changing the "survey" wrapper record in this way.
